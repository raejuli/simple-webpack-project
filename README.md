Simple repo with 2 branches for a generic typescript setup(main branch), and one involving react with a dev-server(react branch).

Assuming you have npm installed, run `npm i` then `npm run build` to simply build the project(main branch), or run `npm run serve` to start the dev server and start compiling(react branch).
Navigate to `localhost:8080` if running the dev server to the output.
